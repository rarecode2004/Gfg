Given an integer n, find the number of divisors of n that are divisible by 3.

Examples:

Input: n = 6
Output: 2
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 6 are divisors of 6 out of which 3 and 6 are divisible by 3.
Input: n = 10
Output: 0
Explanation: 1, 2, 5 and 10 are divisors of 10 but none of them are divisible by 3.
Constraints:
1 <= n <= 105

CODE:

class Solution {
    static int countDivisors(int n) {
        int i,j,c=0;
        for(i=1;i<=n;i++){
            if(n%i==0 && i%3==0){
                c++;
            }
        }
        return c;
    }
}
