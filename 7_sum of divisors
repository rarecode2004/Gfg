Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 53.67%Submissions: 8K+Points: 1
Given a natural number n, calculate sum of all its proper divisors. A proper divisor of a natural number is the divisor that is strictly less than the number.

Example 1:

Input: n = 10
Output: 8 
Explanation: Proper divisors 1 + 2 + 5 = 8. 

Example 2:

Input: n = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: Proper divisors 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. 

CODE:

class Solution {
    static long divSum(long n){
        long i,sum=0;
        for(i=1;i<n;i++){
            if(n%i==0){
                sum+=i;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
